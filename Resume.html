        The project was called ‘Sing Along, Play Along’; it ran for 5 months and was entirely online as a response to the pandemic. My role within it was to contact artists and performers for their involvement, to be on hand during each performance as the software/sound technician. I managed the website and social media platforms; updating and publishing new content, making sure there was active engagement with our audience.</h3>
